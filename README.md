# TipCalculator
This is an iOS app for calculating the tip on a bill. I followed along the tutorial found [here](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/build-ios-apps/build-a-tip-calculator-in-swift-4/intro-tip-calculator). This was made so I can learn more about how to use Swift.

Please direct all issues and sugguestions to the issues tab above.
